# Welcome to the RetroStack GitHub page!

RetroStack is passionate about exploring and preserving the legacy of older computer systems. My work involves creating detailed documentation and videos to share knowledge. I am also dedicated to reviving these classic systems by reimplementing them and offering replacement parts at no cost. If you're keen on supporting this unique project, I invite you to visit my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/retrostack). Your support would be immensely valuable and greatly appreciated!
